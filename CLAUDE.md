## Repository Status

This is a new repository for "Eski-Layer-Manager" that currently contains minimal content. The repository name suggests it will be a layer management system, but the architecture and technology stack have not yet been established.

## Current State

- The repository contains only a `helloworld.txt` file
- No build system, dependencies, or code structure has been set up yet
- No programming language or framework has been selected

## Getting Started

When beginning development on this repository:

1. Determine the purpose and requirements of the layer manager
2. Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks
3. Set up project structure (package.json/requirements.txt/etc. depending on language)
4. Establish build, test, and development workflows
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with relevant architectural information and commands
