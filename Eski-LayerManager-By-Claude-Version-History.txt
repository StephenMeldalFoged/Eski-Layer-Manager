VERSION HISTORY - Eski Layer Manager
=====================================

This file tracks features added in each version to help jump back to specific versions if needed.

---

Version 0.1.0 (Initial Setup)
Date: 2025-12-03
Git Tag: v0.1.0

Features:
- Repository initialized
- Basic project structure established
- Technology decision: Python with PySide6 for UI, pymxs for 3ds Max API access

---

Version 0.2.0 (Basic Dockable Window)
Date: 2025-12-03
Git Tag: v0.2.0 (to be created)

Features:
- Created eski-layer-manager.py main script
- Implemented QDockWidget-based dockable window
- Window title: "Eski LayerManager by Claude 0.2.0"
- Connection to 3ds Max main window via qtmax.GetQMaxMainWindow()
- Dockable to left and right sides only
- Window set to dock right side by default
- Placeholder UI with empty shell
- Proper window flags and cleanup on close
- show_layer_manager() function to launch from 3ds Max
- Standalone testing capability outside 3ds Max

Usage in 3ds Max:
  import eski_layer_manager
  eski_layer_manager.show_layer_manager()

---

Version 0.6.1 (Nested Layer Hierarchy Support)
Date: 2025-12-04
Git Tag: v0.6.1 (to be created)

Features:
- Full nested layer hierarchy support
- Displays parent-child layer relationships with indentation
- Automatically expands parent layers by default (like native layer manager)
- Drag-and-drop layer reparenting
  - Drop ON a layer to make it a child
  - Drop ABOVE/BELOW a layer to make it a sibling
  - Drop on empty space to make it a root layer
  - Circular reference prevention (can't make layer child of itself or descendant)
- Recursive layer tree traversal for finding and selecting layers
- MAXScript API methods used:
  - layer.getParent() - Get parent layer
  - layer.setParent(parent) - Set parent layer
  - layer.getNumChildren() - Count child layers
  - layer.getChild(index) - Get child by 1-based index
- Alphabetical sorting maintained at each hierarchy level
- Test mode includes sample hierarchy for UI development
- New debug output: [HIERARCHY] prefix for hierarchy operations
- New debug output: [DRAG] prefix for drag-and-drop operations

Usage in 3ds Max:
  import eski_layer_manager
  eski_layer_manager.show_layer_manager()

  # Drag layers to reparent them
  # Drop on a layer to nest under it
  # Drop between layers to make siblings
  # Drop on empty space to make root

Version 0.6.2 (Nested Layers Debug & Fix)
Date: 2025-12-04
Git Tag: v0.6.2 (to be created)

Features:
- Enhanced debug output for nested layer operations
- Better error handling for getParent() to handle pymxs undefined values
- Added extensive [HIERARCHY] debug messages showing:
  - Parent layer detection for each layer
  - Root layer identification
  - Child count for each layer
  - Individual child names
- Fixed parent detection to check string representation of undefined
- Added try-catch blocks around all hierarchy operations

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed issue with detecting root layers (parent comparison with undefined)
- Added fallback for layers where getParent() fails

---

Version 0.6.3 (Tree View UI Improvements)
Date: 2025-12-04
Git Tag: v0.6.3 (to be created)

Features:
- Explicitly enabled tree view hierarchy visualization
- Added setIndentation(20) for proper child indentation
- Added setRootIsDecorated(True) to show expand/collapse arrows
- Added setAnimated(True) for smooth expand/collapse animations
- Tree now properly shows hierarchy with visual arrows like native layer manager

UI Improvements:
- Expand/collapse arrows now visible for parent layers
- 20px indentation for child layers
- Smooth animation when expanding/collapsing
- Matches native layer manager visual style

---

Version 0.6.4 (Reduce Debug Spam)
Date: 2025-12-04
Git Tag: v0.6.4 (to be created)

Changes:
- Removed all debug print statements to stop MAXScript Listener spam
- Kept only [ERROR] print statements for critical issues
- Replaced debug prints with pass statements to maintain code structure
- Much cleaner output - only shows errors when they occur

---

Version 0.6.5 (Remove Delegate Spam)
Date: 2025-12-04
Git Tag: v0.6.5 (to be created)

Changes:
- Removed [DELEGATE] debug prints from VisibilityIconDelegate paint method
- No more spam from icon rendering on every repaint
- MAXScript Listener now completely clean - only ERROR messages

---

FUTURE VERSIONS
===============

Version 0.7.0 (Planned)
- Bulk layer visibility & freeze control with isolation mode
- Freeze/unfreeze toggle
- Isolate mode (hide all except selected)

Version 0.8.0 (Planned)
- Quick object selection by layer (click to select all objects)
- Object list display in bottom panel
