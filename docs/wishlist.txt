TOP 5 ESSENTIAL FEATURES
=========================

1. BULK LAYER VISIBILITY & FREEZE CONTROL WITH ISOLATION MODE
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   What it does:
   - Single-click hide/show/freeze/unfreeze toggles for each layer
   - "Isolate" mode: hide all layers except selected one(s)
   - "Solo" selected layer(s) while keeping layer structure visible
   - Batch operations: select multiple layers, apply action to all

   Why it's essential:
   - Most frequently used operation (50+ times per session)
   - Native UI requires multiple clicks through menus
   - Critical for managing complex scenes with 20+ layers
   - Saves 5-10 seconds per operation

   API Methods:
   - layer.ishidden = True/False
   - layer.isfrozen = True/False
   - layer.nodes(nodes_array)


2. QUICK OBJECT SELECTION BY LAYER
   ---------------------------------
   What it does:
   - Click layer to instantly select all objects on that layer
   - Ctrl+Click for additive selection (add to current selection)
   - Visual feedback showing object count per layer
   - "Select by Current Layer" quick button

   Why it's essential:
   - Second most common operation (20-30 times per session)
   - Native workflow requires multiple steps (right-click → Select All)
   - Essential for scene organization and object manipulation
   - Dramatically improves imported CAD file cleanup

   API Methods:
   - layer.select(True)
   - layer.getNumNodes()
   - layer_manager.current


3. DRAG-AND-DROP OBJECT ASSIGNMENT BETWEEN LAYERS
   -----------------------------------------------
   What it does:
   - Drag selected objects from viewport to target layer
   - Move objects between layers by dragging
   - "Add Selection to Layer" dropdown menu
   - Visual indicator showing which layer objects belong to

   Why it's essential:
   - Native "Move to Layer" requires 2-step process
   - Critical for organizing imported scenes and cleanup
   - Used 10-15 times per complex scene
   - Reduces 4-click operation to 1 drag
   - Valuable when inheriting files from other artists

   API Methods:
   - layer.addnode(node)
   - layer_manager.current.addnode(node)
   - for obj in selection: layer.addnode(obj)


4. LAYER HIERARCHY WITH PARENT/CHILD RELATIONSHIPS
   ------------------------------------------------
   What it does:
   - Create nested folder structure for layers (unlimited depth)
   - Expand/collapse parent layers to show/hide children
   - Ctrl+Click to expand/collapse entire hierarchy
   - Drag layers to reparent under different parents
   - Batch operations affect all children (hide parent = hide children)
   - Color-coded hierarchy visualization

   Why it's essential:
   - Critical for large architectural/VFX projects (50+ layers)
   - Most requested feature in community forums
   - Third-party "Nested Layer Manager" is one of most downloaded scripts
   - Reduces cognitive load in 100-layer scenes
   - Organize by building section, object type, or design variant

   API Methods:
   - layer.getParent()
   - layer.setParent(parent_layer)
   - layer.getChild(index)
   - layer.getNumChildren()
   - layer.inheritVisibility


5. SMART LAYER SEARCH/FILTER WITH PROPERTY DISPLAY
   ------------------------------------------------
   What it does:
   - Live search/filter box: type to filter layers by name
   - Filter by state: show only visible/hidden/frozen/active layers
   - Property columns: color swatch, visibility icon, freeze icon, render icon
   - Quick property toggles (checkboxes for render visibility, GI exclusion)
   - Highlight layers containing selected objects
   - "Find Layer of Selected Object" button

   Why it's essential:
   - Native Layer Explorer lacks search functionality
   - In 30+ layer scenes, scrolling wastes time (2-3 min/session)
   - Visual property indicators prevent mistakes
   - Critical for collaborative workflows with inherited layer structures
   - Property visibility prevents rendering errors

   API Methods:
   - layer.name
   - layer.ishidden
   - layer.isfrozen
   - layer.renderable
   - layer.wireColor
   - layer.isGIExcluded
   - layer_manager.getLayerFromName(name)
   - node.layer

HONORABLE MENTIONS (Future Features)
=====================================

6. Layer Color Management
   - Click color swatch to change wireframe color
   - Color presets for quick assignment
   - API: layer.wireColor

7. Create/Rename/Delete Operations
   - "New Layer" with automatic naming
   - "New Layer from Selection"
   - Inline rename (double-click)
   - Safe delete (check if empty)
   - API: layer_manager.newLayer(), layer.setname(), layer_manager.deleteLayerByName()

8. Layer Property Presets
   - Save/load layer configurations
   - Quick apply common property combos (frozen+gray, hidden+non-renderable)
   - Per-project layer templates

9. Quad Menu Integration
   - Right-click quad menu for quick layer operations
   - Context-sensitive options based on clicked layer/object
   - Quick access to: Select Objects, Isolate, Hide/Show, Freeze/Unfreeze
   - "Add Selection to Layer" submenu with layer list
   - "Move to Layer" submenu
   - Customizable menu items and keyboard shortcuts
   - API: Qt context menus, QAction, right-click event handlers

PRIORITY JUSTIFICATION
=======================

Ranking based on:
1. Frequency of use (visibility = 50+ times vs presets = 2-3 times)
2. Time savings (isolation saves 10+ clicks vs rename saves 2 clicks)
3. Native UI pain points (no drag-drop, poor state visibility)
4. Community requests (nested layers top-requested since 2015)
5. Error prevention (visual indicators prevent costly mistakes)

Strategy: Prioritize SPEED of common operations (1-3) over organizational
features (4) over quality-of-life improvements (5+).
